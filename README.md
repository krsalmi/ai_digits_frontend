# Frontend for Digit Recognition Web App
Frontend, built with React, for a digit recognition web app. It allows users to draw digits 
on a canvas and send the drawing to a backend server to predict what digit they drew using a pre-trained machine learning model.
Users can also try retraining the model themselves. The design of the page is original and the image components were made in Canva. Check out the live site at [digitrecognition](https://digitrecognition-ai.onrender.com), hosted on Render. The backend code can be viewed here: [https://github.com/krsalmi/ai_digits_backend.git](https://github.com/krsalmi/ai_digits_backend.git).
